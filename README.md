# Smart-Counter-App

This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation,
event handling, and input validation.

Users can increment or decrement a counter using a custom step value while
preventing invalid inputs or negative results.

The goal of this project is to practice clean logic, user-friendly validation,
and dynamic UI updates using vanilla JavaScript.
